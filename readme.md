# PicoRuby Keyboard Firmware Keymaps
This repository contains build logs and keyboard firmware for each of the keyboard I will hand solder together. I have currently build 1.5 handwired keyboard thus far, and I have required PRK due to the duplex matrices I have implemented in both of the keyboard.

## but why tho
I want to explore firmware outside of qmk. I have built a handwired simple 3 key macro pad using qmk, and the amount setup and building necessary for development is really heavy. I also did not like the aspect of requiring a bodge *ahem* via *ahem* to be able to get away with editing keymaps without the need to recompile the firmware every *single* time.
